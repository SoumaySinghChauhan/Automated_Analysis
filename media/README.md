   - The `quality` rating has a slightly higher mean of about 3.21, indicating that overall, respondents view the quality of the media a bit more positively than the overall experience.

     - **Overall Distribution**: Likely shows a peak around the middle scores, indicating possible satisfaction but also dissatisfaction reflected in lower scores.
     - **Quality Distribution**: Similarly might show that while most find the quality decent, there are outliers for lower quality.
     - **Repeatability Distribution**: Likely demonstrates a focus on lower scores, emphasizing concerns about the media's lasting appeal.

### Implications

Overall, this dataset provides an interesting opportunity to analyze media ratings and could lead to actionable insights for stakeholders in the media industry.
